        Hello! I’m Maria Estrada Miguel. Growing up, I spoke Spanish at home, which gave me a deep
        appreciation for the beauty and richness of the language. With most of my family living in
        Mexico City, I feel incredibly blessed to travel there often and stay connected to my roots.
        Although I studied finance at the University of Minnesota, my passion for teaching Spanish
        has always been a big part of who I am.

        <br />
        <br />
        Spanish has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. Since the moment I could
        speak, I’ve been translating for the people around me—family, friends, and even strangers
        who needed help. Can you imagine a 6-year-old translating at a doctor’s office or trying to
        make sense of legal documents for their parents? That was my reality, and honestly, it
        shaped who I am today. Translating became second nature to me, whether it was helping my
        family, assisting Spanish-speaking individuals at work, or even planning events like Cinco
        de Mayo celebrations for the neighborhood. It’s not just about knowing two languages—it’s
        about bridging gaps, making people feel heard, and ensuring they get the help they need.

        <br />
        <br />

        Growing up bilingual has made a huge difference in my life, especially when it comes to
        connecting with people. Back in high school, I tutored elementary kids, which helped me
        build patience and communication skills—both of which have been essential in my work and
        volunteer experiences. I’ve worked with a lot of Spanish-speaking individuals, whether
        through translating documents, having in-person conversations, or volunteering at places
        like Regions Hospital and the Animal Humane Society. Every time I’m able to help someone
        express themselves, I’m reminded of how valuable it is to know two languages. I feel
        grateful for the opportunities it has given me—not just to open doors for myself, but to
        open them for others too.
